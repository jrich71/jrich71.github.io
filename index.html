            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I am a nationally recognized health informaticist with on-the-ground care delivery experience 
                within multiple settings seeking to make everyday care better by connecting great people with 
                fantastic tech. My experience and expertise span multiple biomedical domains–providing me a broad 
                healthcare perspective–in developing, implementing, and evaluating digital interventions that 
                impact decision-making and clinical workflows. Known as a highly effective collaborator in both 
                operational and research environments, my vision brings together stakeholders on key issues: 
                AI, health informatics, patient-centeredness, and data-driven decision making.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my career I have embedded within clinical teams among a variety of care setttings to develop and evaluate
                ways for delivering knowledge-based resources and sevices to providers, patients, and other customer segments. 
                This has required collaboration with a variety of stakeholders including doctors, nurses, patients, developers, 
                IT staff, information professionals/librarians, and more. I have leveraged a variety of health data and informatics standards 
                including FHIR, electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs), and clinical quality language (CQL) to name a few. In addition 
                to my product development and rollout experience, I am highly-published and get energized when presenting lessons learned 
                and research results.
