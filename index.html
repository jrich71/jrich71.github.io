            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>
                I am a nationally recognized health informaticist with on-the-ground care delivery experience 
                within multiple settings seeking to make everyday care better by connecting great people with 
                fantastic tech. My experience and expertise span multiple biomedical domains–providing me a broad 
                healthcare perspective–in developing, implementing, and evaluating digital interventions that 
                impact decision-making and clinical workflows. Known as a highly effective collaborator in both 
                operational and research environments, my vision brings together stakeholders on key issues: 
                AI, health informatics, patient-centeredness, and data-driven decision making.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my career I have embedded within clinical teams among a variety of care setttings to develop and evaluate
                ways to deliver knowledge-based resources and sevices to providers and patients. This has required of me to 
                work with a variety of health data standards including FHIR, electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs), 
                clinical quality language (CQL), and more; as well as collaborate with a variety of stakeholders from clinicians
                to IT staff to information professionals/librarians. In addition to product development and rollout, I am
                highly-published and get energized when presenting lessons learned and research results.
